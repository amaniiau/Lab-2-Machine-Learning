# Lab-2-Machine-Learning

Type of Machine Learning Problem:
This is a classification problem.

Target Variable:
Yes, the dataset contains a target variable called Heart Disease, which indicates whether a patient has heart disease or not.

Model Objective:
The model is expected to learn patterns from medical features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and heart rate, and use these patterns to predict the presence of heart disease.

Problem Description:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning classification model that predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical and medical attributes. The model will classify patients into two categories: having heart disease or not having heart disease.
