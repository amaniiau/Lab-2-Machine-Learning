# Lab-2-Machine-Learning

Short Written Summary

This project uses a heart disease dataset in CSV format that contains medical and clinical information about patients, including features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and heart rate. The machine learning task is a classification problem aimed at predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not. The dataset includes a target variable called Heart Disease, which indicates the presence or absence of heart disease. The model is expected to learn patterns from the medical features and classify patients into two categories: having heart disease or not having heart disease.

# Defining the Machine Learning Problem
Type of Problem:
This is a classification problem.

Target Variable:
Yes, the dataset includes a target variable called Heart Disease, which indicates whether a patient has heart disease or not.

Model Objective:
The model is expected to learn patterns from the medical features in the dataset and predict the presence or absence of heart disease for a patient.

Problem Description:
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that classifies patients as having heart disease or not based on their medical and clinical attributes.
