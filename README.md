# Lab-2-Machine-Learning

Short Written Summary

This project uses a heart disease dataset in CSV format that contains medical and clinical information about patients, including features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and heart rate. The machine learning task is a classification problem aimed at predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not. The dataset includes a target variable called Heart Disease, which indicates the presence or absence of heart disease. The model is expected to learn patterns from the medical features and classify patients into two categories: having heart disease or not having heart disease.
